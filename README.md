## Books

* [] The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company by Bob Dorf and Steve Blank.

_I'm reading it now. This is a 600+ page "how-to" guide, which requires attention and time. Most of info is covered in blogs or talks, but I'm curious to read this famous book._
